# Programação Dinâmica's Official Bot

This project began as a "certified fan card" generator and has since evolved into a Telegram bot for our YouTube channel, [Programação Dinâmica](https://youtube.com/@pgdinamica).

We developed the visuals for the fan card using Python and the ReportLab library to create vector graphics and save them as a PDF file. You can watch the live stream recording of this process, available to channel members, by clicking on the image below:

Next, we used the python-telegram-bot library to build an interactive interface, allowing anyone to generate their own fan card for our channel. This entire process, from concept to deployment, was documented in another video freely available on our channel:

As we add new features to the bot, this README will be updated to reflect those changes.
